    Emulator                            : SEGGER J-Link Base
                                          (Customers are required to prepare J-Link emulator compatible with RZ/A2M.)


3. About Sample Code

  This sample code operates the following processing.
    Transmitting data to Echo server, and checking the received data are correct.

   Refer to "Ethernet sample program application note(R01AN4639)" 
   for the details about this sample code. 

4. Operation Confirmation Conditions

  (1) Boot mode
    - Boot mode 3
      (Boot from serial flash memory 3.3V)
      * The program can not be operated if the boot mode except the above is specified.

  (2) Operating frequency
      The RZ/A2M clock pulse oscillator is set so that the RZ/A2M clocks on the CPU board
      board have the following frequencies:
      (The frequencies indicate the values in the state that the clock with 24MHz
      is input to the EXTAL pin in RZ/A2M clock mode 1)
      - CPU clock (I clock)                 : 528MHz
      - Image processing clock (G clock)    : 264MHz
      - Internal bus clock (B clock)        : 132MHz
      - Peripheral clock1 (P1 clock)        :  66MHz
      - Peripheral clock0 (P0 clock)        :  33MHz
      - QSPI0_SPCLK                         :  66MHz
      - CKIO                                : 132MHz

  (3) Setting for asynchronous communication
      - Bit rate        : 115200 bps
      - Data bit        : 8 bits
      - Parity bit      : none
      - Stop bit        : 1 bit

  (4) Serial flash memory used
    - Manufacturer  : Macronix Inc.
    - Product No.   : MX25L51245G

  (5) Setting for cache
      Initial setting for the L1 and L2 caches is executed by the MMU. 
      Refer to the "RZ/A2M group Example of Initialization" application note about "Setting for MMU" for 
      the valid/invalid area of L1 and L2 caches.


5. Operational Procedure

  Use the following procedure to execute this sample code.

  (1) Setting for DIP switches and jumpers  
    Set the DIP switches and jumpers of the CPU board as follows.

     <<Setting for CPU board>>
      - SW1-1  : ON  (Disabled SSCG function)
        SW1-2  : OFF (Setting to clock mode 1(EXTAL input clock frequency : 20 to 24MHz))
        SW1-3  : ON  (MD_BOOT2 = L)
        SW1-4  : OFF (MD_BOOT1 = H)
        SW1-5  : OFF (MD_BOOT0 = H)
        SW1-6  : ON  (BSCANP normal mode (CoreSight debug mode))
        SW1-7  : ON  (CLKTEST OFF)
        SW1-8  : ON  (TESTMD OFF)
      - JP1 :   1-2  (Setting to supply 3.3V power for PVcc_SPI of RZ/A2M and U2)
      - JP2 :   2-3  (Setting to supply 1.8V power for PVcc_HO of RZ/A2M and U3)
      - JP3 :   Open (Use USB ch 0 in the function mode (Not supply VBUS0 power))

    Set the DIP switches and jumpers of the SUB board as follows.

     <<Setting for SUB board>>
      - SW6-1  : OFF (Setting to use P9_[7:0], P8_[7:1], P2_2, P2_0, P1_3, P1_[1:0], P0_[6:0], P6_7, P6_5, P7_[1:0] and P7[5:3] 
                      as DRP, audioÅAUARTÅACAN and USB interface terminals respectively)
        SW6-2  : OFF (Setting to use P8_4, P8_[7:6], P6_4 and P9_[6:3] as audio interface terminals)
        SW6-3  : OFF (Setting to use P9_[1:0], P1_0 and P7_5 as UART and USB interface terminals respectively)
        SW6-4  : ON  (P6_[3 :0] and PE_[6 :0] are used as Ethernet PHY1 control pins.)
        SW6-5  : ON  (P3_[5 :1] and PH_5, PK_[4 :0] are used as Ethernet PHY2 control pins.)
        SW6-6  : ON  (Setting to use PJ_[7:6] as VDC6 terminals)
        SW6-7  : ON  (Setting to use P7_[7:4] as VDC6 terminals)
        SW6-8  : OFF (NC)
        SW6-9  : OFF (P5_3 = "H")
        SW6-10 : OFF (PC_2 = "H")

      - JP1 : 2-JP2  (Setting to use PJ_1 as interrupt terminal for IRQ0 switch (SW3))

    Refer to the CPU board and the SUB board user's manual for more details about
    setting for the DIP switches and jumpers.
